# FedDIP: Federated Continual Learning with Dynamic Importance Preservation

📌 **Overview**

FedDIP is a federated learning approach designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in heterogeneous federated environments.
The method relies on client-level parameter importance estimation and an aggregation strategy that preserves knowledge acquired from previous tasks while maintaining adaptability to new tasks.

FedDIP is particularly well suited for scenarios involving:
  - non-IID and distributed data,
  - heterogeneous clients,
  - sequential or evolving tasks,
  - strict data privacy constraints.
